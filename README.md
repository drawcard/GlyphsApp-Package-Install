# GlyphsApp-Package-Install
This is a Bash shell file to install most of the Scripts and Plugins for GlyphsApp.

This Bash shell creates a clone of most of the repositories of Glyphs's Plugins and scripts hosted in GitHub.

Additionaly, this script creates a **sync_git_repos** in `/private/etc/cron.d/` that keep up-to-date the local repositories, doing `fetch` each 5 minutes.

# Install Notes:
1. Download `GlyphsScriptsConfi.sh` from this repository
2. Open Terminal:
3. Go to the same folder where have been downloaded `GlyphsScriptsConfi.sh`. e.g. If  `GlyphsScriptsConfi.sh` was downloaded in the **Downloads** folder, then type in the terminal:  
   ```
   cd ~/Downloads/
   ```
4. Run the `GlyphsScriptsConfi.sh` calling the `sh` enviroment. e.g. Type in the terminal window:
   ```
   sh GlyphsScriptsConfi.sh
   ```
5. At the begining of the installation you will be asked for the user password. Type the password in order to have privilegies to write:  
   ```
   /private/etc/cron.d/sync_git_repos
   ```
6. Forget of keeping updating the repositories, but if you want to be able to update them, so you only need to run
   ```
   GlyphsScripts_updater.sh
   ```
in the same way that it was mentioned with other shell scripts, type in the terminal:  
   ```
   sh GlyphsScripts_updater.sh
   ```
And you will have updated all repositories.

# Uninstall Notes:
1. You should deleted the symbolic links that were created at `~/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Scripts/ ` and then deleted the GlyphsScripts directory created at `~/Documents/GlyphsScripts/`. That is almost all.

2. If you want to deleted what was written in `/etc/cron.d` you only need to type in terminal 
```
sudo rm /private/etc/cron.d/sync_git_repos
```
and put your user password. This step is automatic when you try to install again.
